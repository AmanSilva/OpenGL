# OpenGL

This is a group of projects I made while learning the API OpenGL with C++.


Observations:

* I will be using the library [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/).
* I will be using the package manager [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html).

### What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.

### What is a Graphic API?

A graphic API is a collection of documented libraries and commands that communicate with the computer hardware in creating 2D and 3D applications.
